    x --> initial guess
    How to get initial guess?
    In Bisection method, we used to check: f(a) * f(b) < 0, meaning a root lies between them.

    Here, if we have two guesses x1 and x2, and we know f(x1) and f(x2),
    then we can choose the one with the larger |f(x)| as the initial guess,
    because it's farther from the root, and Newton-Raphson converges quickly.

    But Newton-Raphson typically starts with just one guess.
    You can choose that based on graph, or from interval [a, b] where f(a)*f(b)<0 like in Bisection.
